COntent Oriented Lisp
---------------------

COOL is a prototypical language designed to explore that way 
information-centric networking can impact general-purpose
programming languages and models. The goal is to remove the
"complexity" of I/O from the cognitive load of the programmer,
enabling them to focus only on well-named data.  

TODO:
- Finish the typed and untyped actor (local and remote) implementation
- Complete basic I/O operations
- Add support for user-defined types
- Add support for interfaces and structs (a la Go)
